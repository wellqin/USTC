! what?
`readline` provides an interface to the GNU readline library.

it can be used to enhance interactive command-line programs
to make them easier to use -- for example, by adding command-line text completion, or "tab-completion"

NOTE:
Because readline interacts with the console content, 
printing debug messages makes it difficult to see
what is happening in the sample code versus what readline is doing for free. 

The following examples
use the logging (page 980) module to write debug information to a separate file. The log output is
shown with each example.
