! what?
`configparser` manages user-editable configuration files
for an application using a format similar to Windows INI files.

the contents of the configuration files can be organized into groups
and several option value types are supported,
including integers, floating-point values, and booleans.

option values can be combined using Python formatting strings to build longer values
such as URLs from shorter values such as hostnames and port numbers.
