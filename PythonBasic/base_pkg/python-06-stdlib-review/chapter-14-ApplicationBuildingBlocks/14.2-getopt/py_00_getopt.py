! what?
`getopt` is the original command-line option
that support the conventions established by the Unix function "getopt".

It parses an argument sequence, such as sys.argv,
and returns a sequence of tuples containing (option, argument) pairs
and a sequence of non-option arguments.

NOTE: getopt is not deprecated, but argparse (page 888) is more actively maintained and should be used
for new development.
