! what?
`cgitb` is valuable debugging tool in the standard library.
it was originally designed fro showing errors and debugging information in web applications.

althou it was later updated to include plain text output as well,
unfortunately the module was never renamed..

consequently, the module is not used as often as it could be,
even thou it includes more detailed traceback information than
`traceback`

! why?



! how?

cgitb: detailed traceback reports
|-- standard traceback dumps
|-- enabling detailed tracebacks
|-- local variables in tracebacks
|-- exception properties
|-- html output
|-- logging tracebacks
