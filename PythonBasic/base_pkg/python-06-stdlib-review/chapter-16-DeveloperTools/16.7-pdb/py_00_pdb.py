! what?
`pdb` implements an interactive debugging environment for Python programs.

it includes features to pause a program,
look at the values of variables,
and watch program execution unfold step by step,
so you can understand what the program actually does and find bugs in the logic.

NOTE:
sometimes, i really miss VS debugger. shift+f8
program flow, stat, stack etc show in panes.
