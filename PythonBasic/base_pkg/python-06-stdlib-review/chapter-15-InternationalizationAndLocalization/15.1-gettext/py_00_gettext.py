Python comes with two modules for preping an application
to work with multiple natural languages and cultural settings.

`gettext` is used to create message catalogs in different languages,
so that prompts and error messages can be displayed in a language 
that user can understand.


`locale` changes the way numbers, currency, dates and times are formatted
to take into account cultural differences such as how negative values tools
and the operating environment,
so that the Python application will fit in with all of the other programs on the system.

! why?
