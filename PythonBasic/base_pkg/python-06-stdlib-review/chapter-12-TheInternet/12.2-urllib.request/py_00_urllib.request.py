! what?
the Internent is a pervasive aspect of modern computing.
even small, single-use scripts frequently interact with remote services to send or receive data.

Python's rich set of tools for working with web prototcols 
makes it well suited for programming web-based applications,
either as a client or as a server.


`urllib.request` implements an API for retrieveing content remotely.

HTTP POST requests are usually "form encoded" with `urlib`.
Binary data sent through a POST should be encoded with `base64` first,
to comply with the message format standard.

! why?
why not
