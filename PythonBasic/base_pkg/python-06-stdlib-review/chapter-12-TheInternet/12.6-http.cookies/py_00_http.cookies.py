! what?
the Internent is a pervasive aspect of modern computing.
even small, single-use scripts frequently interact with remote services to send or receive data.

Python's rich set of tools for working with web prototcols 
makes it well suited for programming web-based applications,
either as a client or as a server.

session state in the server can be managed throu cookies
created and parsed by the `http.cookies`.

Full support for expiration, path, domain, and other cookie
settings makes it easy to configure the session

! why?
why not

! how?

the http.cookies module implements a parser for cookies 
that is mostly RFC 2019 compliant.

the implementation is a little less strict than the standard 
because MSIE 3.0x does not support the entire standard.

http.cookies: HTTP Cookies
|-- Creating and Setting a Cookie
|-- Morsels
|-- Encoding Values
|-- Receiving and Parsing Cookies Headers
|-- Alternative Output Formats
