! what?
the Internent is a pervasive aspect of modern computing.
even small, single-use scripts frequently interact with remote services to send or receive data.

Python's rich set of tools for working with web prototcols 
makes it well suited for programming web-based applications,
either as a client or as a server.

yeah, i know it alrdy

! why?
why not

! how?

The json module provides an API `similar` to pickle (page 396) for converting in-memory
Python objects to a serialized representation known as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

Unlike pickle, JSON has the benefit of having implementations in many languages
(especially JavaScript). 

It is most used for communicating between the web server and client in a REST API, 
but can also help meet other interapplication communication needs.
