From the programmerâ€™s perspective, there are two essential differences between using a Unix
domain socket and an TCP/IP socket. 

First, the address of the socket is a path on the file system, 
rather than a tuple containing the server name and port. 

Second, the node created in the file system to represent the socket persists after the socket is closed, 
so it needs to be removed each time the server starts.
