! what?
the `socket` module exposes the low-level C API for communicating over a network 
using the BSD socket interface.

it includes the socket class, for handling the actual data channel,
as well as functions for network-related tasks 
such as converting a server's name to an address and formatting data to be sent across the network

! why?
i have no fkin idea, friend
the low-level `socket` library provides direct access to the native C socket library,
and can be used to communicate with any network service.

! how?
